### Problem 1.

Find $f'(x)$.

$$f(x) =  \frac{2x^3}{3} + \frac{x^5}{7} - \frac{2}{\sqrt[3]{x}} + \frac{5}{6\sqrt{x}} + 2024$$

\
\
\
\

$$f(x) = (\sqrt{x}+1)(x+1)$$

\
\
\
\
\

 $$f(x) = \frac{x-1}{x+1} \text{   (Simplify your answers.)}$$ 

\
\
\
\
\

$$f(x) = x\sin x$$

\
\
\
\
\

$$f(x) = \frac{x}{\tan x}$$
\
\
\
\
\

$$f(x) = \cos^{2024} x$$

\
\
\
\
\

$$f(x) = \cos(3x^2+x+1)$$

\
\
\
\
\

$$f(x) = \tan\bigg(\cos x + \sqrt{x}\bigg)$$

\
\
\
\
\

$$f(x) = \bigg(\cos x+\sin x\bigg)^{2024}$$

\
\
\
\
\

$$f(x) = 2024^x + 7^x - 2\log_{9}x + 3\ln x - \frac{3\log_2 x}{5} + \frac{\log_7 x}{3} + 2024$$

### Problem 2

$$
y + xy - 2x^3 = 1
$$

(a) Find $dy/dx$ or $y'$ by differentiating implicitly.

\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\

(b) Solve the equation for y as a function of x, and find $dy/dx$
from that equation.

\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\

### Problem 3

Given the equation 

$$
x^3 + y^3 = 3xy
$$

1. Use implicit differentiation to find $dy/dx$ or $y'$
\
\
\
\
\

2.  Find an equation for the tangent line at the point (3/2, 3/2)
\
\
\
\
\



### Problem 4

(a) Find the local linear approximation of $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ at $x_0 = 1$
\
\
\
\
\



(b) Use the local linear approximation obtained in part (a) to approximate $\sqrt{1.1}$
